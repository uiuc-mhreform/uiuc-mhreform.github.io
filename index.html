          We need to change the way our university handles mental health.

      <div class="who-we-are section">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The UIUC Mental Health Reform was supposed to be a final project that turned into something bigger. Under Professor Billy Huff, we were supposed to have a demonstration that unfortunately had to be cancelled due to apparent "university policy violations."
          Instead of letting the University stop us, we formed our own indepedent student activist group outside the classroom.
